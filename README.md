# Morello Project Website

This is the git repository for the Morello Project Website.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ resources
â”‚   â””â”€â”€content/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€data/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€rows/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€sections/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

### Data

The `src/content/data` folder contains various lists of one-off items used in the site, namely the nav links, footer links and members. Any items added to these lists will be reflected in the website.

### Pages

Pages can be edited via the relevant `.md or mdx` files in the `src/content/pages` folder. New pages containing the nav, header, footer and a body of rendered markdown content can be implemented by adding `.md || .mdx` files to this folder (as with the cookies, conduct and governance pages). If rendered markdown content is not sufficient, please contact [it-support@linaro.org](mailto:it-support@linaro.org) to discuss implementing a new page.

### Rows

The Src /content /rows folder contains a container for content of all of the pages row.

### Sections

The Src /content /sections folder containes various list of items in section part of each page.
